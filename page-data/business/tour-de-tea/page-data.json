Dedicated to improving sustainability in the tea industry, Tour de Tea is the first tea store to offer zero waste options for customers, and reusable tasting cups instore. Sharing a great passion for quality, and collaborating with some of Brisbane's finest venues, Tour de Tea has loved being a part of building Brisbane's growing tea culture and educating locals about tea. ","product_details":"We are a tiny family business, two sisters, who have expanded our parents' market tea stall into a beautiful emporium in one of Brisbane's rose filled, jacaranda laden suburbs. Our teas are from all over the world, and we've spent the last year building our business among new farm locals, and artisan cafes and grocers. We are just over a year old, so this has been a really difficult time to shut up shop when we're still in the growing phase, but we're very excited to get to the other side and see what the future holds.","new_products":"Free delivery to inner Brisbane.\r\nFlat rate 9.50 across Australia - perfect for isolation 'pick me up gifts' sent directly to friends and family.\r\n","website":"https://www.tourdetea.com.au/","headline":"Tour de Tea","offerings":[{"id":1,"name":"online"},{"id":3,"name":"delivery"},{"id":4,"name":"discounts"}],"categories":[{"id":1,"name":"retail"}],"slug":"tour-de-tea","suburb":"New Farm","images":{"header_image":"http://carrythroughcovid.herokuapp.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBhdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--65f58321802cedd7b33633b74b76bf1f2bd9c3d8/image000000.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tour-de-tea"}}}
